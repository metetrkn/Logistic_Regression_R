# Logistic Regression Project

This project involves building and evaluating a logistic regression model in R to predict whether a user will purchase an item based on features like Age, Estimated Salary, and Gender.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Social_Network_Ads.csv" file.

## Setup

Make sure to install the required R packages:

```R
# Install required packages
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2"))
```

## Execution
Run the script logistic_regression_script.R to import the data, preprocess it, and train the logistic regression model.

The trained model is then used to make predictions on the test dataset.

Evaluate the model's performance, calculating accuracy as the primary metric.
